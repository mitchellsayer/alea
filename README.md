# alea

Functions and abstractions for random variables and vectors.

## Usage

alea will be made available on PyPI sometime in the future when
it is more mature. API documentation will also be included.

## Testing

To test alea locally, ensure that the following tools are installed:

* Python 3.7+
* pipenv
* pytest

After cloning this repository, run the following commands:

```
cd alea
pipenv install
pipenv run pytest
```

This will run all unit tests in the tests directory.
